## Based on Pro Git book
* git add: treat as "add precisely to the commit next time", not the "add new files only"
* git add:  If  you  modify  a  file  after  you  run  git add,  you  have  to  run  git add  again  to  stage  the
latest version of the file!
* git diff: It’s  important  to  note  that  git  diff  by  itself  doesn’t  show  all  changes  made  since  your  last
commit — only  changes  that  are  still  unstaged.  If  you’ve  staged  all  of  your  changes,  git diff  will
give you no output.
